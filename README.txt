This is my Popular Movies App for the Udacity Android Fundamentals Course.

If you would like to run this app, you will need a MovieDB API key.

You can get a key here: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup

Once you have a key, replace PUT_YOUR_KEY_HERE with your key in the file app/build.gradle.
